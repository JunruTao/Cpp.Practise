Learning c++ and practice
> current learning subject:
* `OOP and Inheritance`

* `smart pointers`
* `multi-threading`

#####7/8/2020 Update:
Having issues using pthread using MinGW libraries, however the thread functions in Visual Studio is working just fine. New Project is appended down to pratices some threading techniques using modern C++ 11 or higher functions. So more updates will be focused on:
* `std::future`
* `std::promise`
* `std::async`'s thread pool features to start tasks
* `std::mutax` `std::lock()`- `lock_guard<>`, `unique_lock<>`
